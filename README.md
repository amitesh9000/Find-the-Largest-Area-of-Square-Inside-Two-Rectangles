There exist n rectangles in a 2D plane with edges parallel to the x and y axis. You are given two 2D integer arrays bottomLeft and topRight where bottomLeft[i] = [a_i, b_i] and topRight[i] = [c_i, d_i] represent the bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the ith rectangle, respectively.
You need to find the maximum area of a square that can fit inside the intersecting region of at least two rectangles. Return 0 if such a square does not exist.
